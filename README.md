Bean Door Watcher
========

A demo connecting the Lightblue Bean accelerometer to a Node server via node-serialport to detect the opening and closing of a door. It responds by turning a LIFX lightbulb on and off via IFTTT.

If you make something neat from this, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy.

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I've got a range of different IoT/wearable/VR/AR demos up there!

I've also got a site dedicated to developer resources for emerging tech like the IoT, wearables, VR, AR and artificial intelligence over at http://www.devdiner.com :)
